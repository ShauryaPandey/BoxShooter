# BoxShooter
Unity 3D game

# Description:
This Unity based game has 2 levels, this is a very basic First Person Shooter(FPS) game. It helped further my understanding on design and development with Unity.

# Prerequisites:
You must be having firefox. If not then to run on other browsers you should have a http server to run the application, which is a webGL build.

# Installing:
Pull the repository to your local machine. If you have firefox, run index.html on it. If you dont have firefox, and want to continue with the browser of your choice, use a web server like mongoose to run it on the berowser you have.

# Failing to run on firefox:
In case you get an error dialog which says, : "It seems your browser does not support running Unity WebGL content from file:// urls. Please upload it to an http server, or try a different browser"
then, change "privacy.file_unique_origin" to "false" in about:config

# Built with:
Unity
